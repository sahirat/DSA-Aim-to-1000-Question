// As there is an array we passed while calling ,So this array stores value and for same prblm if calling comes it will return it by it's previous store value .So that
// it will not execute multiple times 



// So Prblm is like that
 1.  You are given a number n, representing the number of stairs in a staircase.
2. You are on the 0th step and are required to climb to the top.
3. In one move, you are allowed to climb 1, 2 or 3 stairs.
4. You are required to print the number of different paths via which you can climb to the top.
